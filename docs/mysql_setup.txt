Mysql Setup instructions for Python2.5 / Leopard 10.5.2:
--------------------------------------------------------
- All information accurate at time of release
- Steps are the same, version numbers probably have changed
- This is a guide, you need to use your brain to figure things out
- I will not answer any questions pertaining to installation / setup



Install MySQL server for Leopard:
---------------------------------
- We need the binaries so they can be included in the python install
- Download whichever version you wish from this site (I recommend the package
  installer)

  http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#macosx-dmg

- Install like a normal Mac package:
  - Install the main package (not the startupitem package)
  - Install the prefpane package, if you want to run mysql server locally



Extract Mysql-Python API:
-------------------------
- We are assuming the file is downloaded to ~/Desktop/
- We are assuming the package name is MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz
- Download the latest source for mysql-python

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/

- Open a terminal window
- Navigate to where you downloaded the file and extract the archive

  cd ~/Desktop/
  tar xfv MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz



Modify site.cfg for Mysql-Python API:
-------------------------------------
- Navigate to package directory, and edit site.cfg

  cd ~/Desktop/MySQL-python-1.2.2/
  open site.cfg -a TextEdit

- Change the folowing line in the file (around line 13):

  #mysql_config = /usr/local/bin/mysql_config
  
    TO:
  
  mysql_config = /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config



Modify _mysql.c for Mysql-Python API (compile bug fix):
-------------------------------------------------------
- This fixes a duplicate unsigned int definition error, and may be fixed in a
  later package of MySQL-Python.  If you don't find it, it has been fixed.
- Navigate to package directory, and edit _mysql.c

  cd ~/Desktop/MySQL-python-1.2.2/
  open _mysql.c -a TextEdit

- Remove the following lines (37-39):

    #ifndef uint
    #define uint unsigned int
    #endif



Build Mysql-Python API Module:
------------------------------
- Nagivate to directory and build

  cd ~/Desktop/MySQL-python-1.2.2/
  python setup.py clean
  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install
  
  - you can ignore any compile warnings
  
  

Enjoy!
